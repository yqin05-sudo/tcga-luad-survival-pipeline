# 📊 Overview

This repository provides a fully reproducible **end-to-end survival analysis pipeline** for  
**TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)** including:

- Clinical data parsing from GDC JSON  
- Variable harmonization & cleaning  
- Treatment engineering (Surgery / Chemo / Radiation)  
- Survival time calculation  
- Cox proportional hazards modeling  
- KM survival visualization  
- Interactive Shiny survival prediction app  

This pipeline is designed for:

- Oncology researchers  
- Clinical collaborators  
- Biostatistics / data science teams  
- Reproducible research projects

# 🧬 Data Processing Pipeline

### **1. Parse GDC JSON**
- Unnest nested fields: demographics, diagnoses, treatments, exposures, follow-ups  
- Handle missing or optional structures  
- Convert into tidy tibble format  

### **2. Clean & Merge Clinical Variables**
- Extract primary diagnosis  
- Extract AJCC stage (T / N / M)  
- Extract ECOG & Karnofsky (preoperative)  
- Merge exposures (smoking status, pack years)  
- Maintain **exactly 585 LUAD cases**

### **3. Engineer Treatment Indicators**
Create binary variables:

- `has_surgery`
- `has_chemotherapy`
- `has_radiotherapy`

Using both:
- `treatment_type`  
- `treatment_or_therapy`

### **4. Survival Endpoints**
- OS_time_months = days_to_death or days_to_last_follow_up  
- OS_event = 1 (deceased) / 0 (alive)  
- Handles censoring and missingness

### **5. Cox PH Modeling**
- Fixed-effects Cox  
- PH assumption via cox.zph  
- Export model object + summary  
- Supports time-dependent term (optional)

### **6. Visualization**
- Kaplan-Meier curves  
- Forest plots  
- Publication-ready PNGs saved in `results/`

### **7. Shiny App (Prototype)**
- Loads Cox model  
- Generates personalized survival curves  
- Treatment comparison  
- Clinical decision support (prototype)

## 📘 Data Use & Compliance Statement

This repository uses publicly available, open-access data from the  
**NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC)** and **TCGA-LUAD** project.

### ✔ Compliance with NIH/NCI Policies
All analyses, scripts, and derived datasets in this repository comply with:

- GDC Data Sharing Policy  
- TCGA Publication Guidelines  
- NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy  
- Open-access data usage requirements

### ✔ No Controlled-Access or Identifiable Data
This project **does not use** controlled-access files, protected patient data,  
or any form of PHI/PII.  
Only **open-access TCGA clinical metadata** and **public molecular summaries** are used.

All derived datasets produced by this workflow are fully de-identified  
and compliant with GDC open-access standards.

### ✔ Data Redistribution
Per GDC/TCGA policy:

- Original raw data (JSON, clinical source files) **are not redistributed** in this repository.  
  Users must download them directly from the GDC Portal.
- This repository provides only **code**, allowing reproducible data processing.

### ✔ Intended Use
This repository and its codebase **may be used for research, commercial, or consulting purposes**,  
as permitted under the **GDC Open Access Terms of Use**.

However, the outputs and example models **are not intended for direct clinical decision-making**  
or as a substitute for professional medical judgment.

### ✔ Attribution
When using this repository, please cite:

> The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network  
> Genomic Data Commons (GDC), National Cancer Institute.

## ⚠️ Clinical / Medical Disclaimer

The survival models, R scripts, and Shiny applications provided in this repository are  
**research and analytical tools** designed to support methodological development, education,  
and exploratory analysis in oncology.

They are **not** intended to replace clinical judgment, medical diagnosis, or patient-specific  
treatment decisions.

- All predictions generated by these models should be interpreted by qualified professionals  
  and within the broader clinical context.
- Clinical decisions must rely on a combination of medical expertise, diagnostics, imaging,  
  pathology, and institutional guidelines — **not solely on model outputs**.
- The author assumes no clinical liability for medical or treatment decisions made using  
  any information from this repository.

Use of this repository implies acknowledgment and acceptance of these terms.
